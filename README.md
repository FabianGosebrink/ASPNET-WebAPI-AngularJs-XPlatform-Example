# AngularJs and ASp.NET WebAPI XPlatform-Example

An example of an AngularJs-Application turning into a (real) X-Platform-Application using Grunt as Taskrunner, bower, npm, ASP.NET WEBAPI and gulp.

Special Thanks to the Boardz!-Example from Thinktecture <a href="https://github.com/thinktecture/boardz-cross-platform-sample">Sample application for various “Cross-Platform HTML5 – in Action!” workshops</a> 

You can clone this repo and run <pre>npm install</pre> <pre>bower install</pre>

After this you can run <pre>gulp prod:build:all</pre> to build all in a ".dist" folder.

if you have problems in "web-createHtmlTemplates" navigate to the "node_modules\gulp-header"-Folder and run "npm install" in this folder explicitly. This shall fix the issue.

From here  <a href="https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3554"> Gulp build fail #3554 </a>
